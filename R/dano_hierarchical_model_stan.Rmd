## General notes

Useful sources for Bayesian population models and Bayesian implementation in R that we referenced while building this script: 

* https://github.com/DanOvando/learn-stan 
* https://arxiv.org/src/2002.02001v1/anc/Appendix_S1.pdf p. 72
* https://cchecastaldo.github.io/BayesianShortCourse/Syllabus.html
* https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_25/stan-users-guide/mark-recapture-models.html 
* https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_25/functions-reference/nbalt.html (and entire manual)

## Model notes

* Stan can't estimate discrete latent variables, so we've moved N from being discrete to continuous

## To-do (short term) 

* Revisit choices of initial values, especially when adding in dimensions over which variables are indexed, which will reduce the total number of individuals in each cell
* Add random Poisson noise around estimates of N every year (took this out to ensure Stan model was working correctly)
* Move away from uniform priors (done?)
* Figure out how to deal with true NAs in data, which are instances with no samples of a patch in a year (not true zeroes, although I've replaced them with zeroes temporarily)
* Add stage structure and transition rates 
* Add in dispersal between patches
* Replace r (and/or dispersal rates) with temperature-dependent functions
* Choose data models for all species (currently just modeling fluke) 

## dan's changes

OK, there's a lot going on here. 

- change estimation of N to estimation of process error terms

- basically get rid of population model.... 

What would this ideally look like?

If you're observing total N across all age classes, you could just estimate N in each time step as a random walk / AR processm, where you can set an autocorrelation strength...

So then you can estimate a CV and an autocorrelation


## stage-prep model

Tried this version, but doesn't really work with just one stage. Once we get multipple stages, can separate out recruitment and mortality. 

here is a suggestion for an alternative model structure. Following the idea here, this is a simplified version with 1 "stage", but can easily be generalized to multiple stages with length transition matrices 

for time *t* and patche *p*, estimate

$$n_{t = 1,p} \sim negbinom(x,sigma_{obs})$$

for future time steps

$$n_{t,p} = n_{t-1,p}e^{-m} + r_{t,p}$$

where *r* is recruits is an AR1 process 

$raw$ are independent recruitment deviates


$$raw_t \sim lnorm(-\sigma_r^2/2,\sigma_r)$$

$$r_{t=1,p} = raw_{t=1}$$

and 


$$r_{t,p} = \alpha \times r_{t-1,p} +  \sqrt{1 - \alpha^2}\times raw_t)$$

## AR1 Model

To keep is simpler for now, shifting this to just an autoregressive (AR) 1 model, where process error in time step t is potentially correlated with process error in time t - 1. 

This works, and I think lays the foundation for 

for time *t* and patche *p*, estimate

$$n_{t = 1,p} \sim negbinom(x,sigma_{obs})$$

for future time steps

$$n_{t,p} = n_{t-1,p}e^{r_{t,p}}$$

where *r* is is an AR1 process error term

$raw$ are independent recruitment deviates


$$raw_t \sim norm(-\sigma_r^2/2,\sigma_r)$$

$$r_{t=1,p} = raw_{t=1,p}$$

and 

$$r_{t,p} = -\sigma_r^2/2 + \alpha \times  (r_{t - 1,p} - -\sigma_r^2/2) + raw_{t=1,p}$$

and 

$$\sigma_{obs} \sim normal(0.75, 0.25)$$

$$\sigma_r \sim normal(.5,.25)$$
$$\alpha \sim normal(0,.25)$$

From there, we generate posterior predictive to the fits, and then use the posterior predictive to generate the predictions for the future, where now we generate both process error and observation error for the projected time steps 


```{r}
sigma_r <- 0.2

p <- .5

y <- 100

rec_dev <- rep(0, y)

rec_dev[1] <- rlnorm(1, -sigma_r ^ 2 / 2, sigma_r)

for (t in 2:y) {
  rec_dev[t] <-
    rec_dev[t - 1] * p + rlnorm(1, -sigma_r ^ 2 / 2, sigma_r) * sqrt(1 - p ^ 2)
}

plot(rec_dev)

```
So just estimate a vector of recruitemtn deviates with the prior defined as above 





```{r data, eval=TRUE}
#library(rjags)

#library(MCMCvis)

# dogfish <- read_csv(here("processed-data","dogfish_prepped_data.csv"))

# dogfishTest <- dogfish %>% 
#   filter(lengthclass=="adult") %>% 
#   group_by(year) %>% 
#   mutate(num_obs = sum(numlengthclass),
#          sd_obs = sd(numlengthclass)) %>% # this is standard deviation of different counts in a year, not of overall abundance over time
#   select(year, num_obs, sd_obs) %>% 
#   distinct()
# moving away from spiny dogfish because it is massively overdispersed and no single distribution will be able to produce values at low densities (1, 3, 10...) and at very high densities (5000, 8000, 10000) of dogfish; will eventually need a mixture model, and/or to totally disregard small values and assume everything under some threshold is basically equivalent

fluke <- read_csv(here("processed-data","fluke_prepped_data.csv"))

fluke_lat_time <- fluke %>% 
  mutate(lat_round = round(lat)) %>% 
  filter(lengthclass=="adult",
         year>=1973,
         lat_round >= 34,
         lat_round < 43 # because we're just using nefsc survey for now, which rarely goes below 34N
         ) %>% 
  group_by(year, lat_round) %>% 
  summarise(num_obs = sum(numlengthclass)) %>% 
  ungroup()

fluke_train <- fluke_lat_time %>% 
  filter(year <= 2012)

fluke_test <- fluke_lat_time %>% 
  filter(year > 2012)


head(fluke_lat_time)

fluke_lat_time %>%
ggplot(aes(year, num_obs, color = factor(lat_round))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~lat_round, scales = "free_y")


fluke_lat_time %>%
ggplot(aes(num_obs)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```

And model implementation from R:

y_array <- reshape2::acast(fluke_train, lat_round~year, value.var="num_obs") # could also do this with pivot_wider
y_array <- replace_na(y_array, 0) # DANGER! this is writing over true NAs (years with zero samples in a lat band) with zeroes. I'm doing this here for coding simplicity but need to fix it later.
z0 <- fluke_train %>% filter(year == min(year)) %>% arrange(lat_round) %>% pull(num_obs)

proj_init <- fluke_test %>% filter(year == min(year)) %>% arrange(lat_round) %>% pull(num_obs)


# starting values from real data

                  len_i=length(unique(fluke_train$lat_round)),

                  z0=z0 + 1e-3,# vector of starting pop. sizes from lowest lat to highest; should have length of len_i
                  len_t_proj = n_distinct(fluke_test$year),
                  proj_init = proj_init + 1e-3

Evaluating the model:

```{r model1 eval}
# summary(model1_fit)
# plot(model1_fit)
# check_divergences(model1_fit)
# rstanarm::launch_shinystan(model1_fit)

# convert to a df 


predicted_fluke <- tidybayes::gather_draws(model1_fit,y_hat[patch,year], n = 1000) %>% 
         mutate(patch = as.numeric(patch), 
         lat = patch + min(fluke_lat_time$lat_round) - 1,
         year = year + min(fluke_lat_time$year) - 1) 

pp_predicted_fluke <- tidybayes::gather_draws(model1_fit,pp_y_hat[patch,year], n = 1000) %>% 
         mutate(patch = as.numeric(patch), 
         lat = patch + min(fluke_lat_time$lat_round) - 1,
         year = year + min(fluke_lat_time$year) - 1) 

pp_projected_fluke <- tidybayes::gather_draws(model1_fit,pp_proj_y_hat[patch,year], n = 1000) %>% 
         mutate(patch = as.numeric(patch), 
         lat = patch + min(fluke_lat_time$lat_round) - 1,
         year = year + min(fluke_test$year) - 1) 
```

```{r model1 plot}
predicted_fluke %>% 
  ggplot() +
  stat_lineribbon(aes(x = year, y = .value),.width = c(.99, .95, .8, .5), color = "red") +
  geom_point(data = fluke_train %>% rename(lat = lat_round), aes(year, num_obs), size = 2,alpha = 0.5) + 
  facet_wrap(~lat, scales = "free_y") + 
  scale_fill_brewer()

```


 Posterior predictive fits
 
 
```{r}
pp_predicted_fluke %>% 
  ggplot() +
  stat_lineribbon(aes(x = year, y = .value),.width = c(.99, .95, .8, .5), color = "red") +
  geom_point(data = fluke_train %>% rename(lat = lat_round), aes(year, num_obs), size = 2,alpha = 0.5) + 
  facet_wrap(~lat, scales = "free_y") + 
  scale_fill_brewer()
```

Posterior predictive projections: basically in the absence of more structure the AR1 process is useless after about 4 years, but it's a start

```{r}
pp_projected_fluke %>% 
  ggplot() +
  stat_lineribbon(aes(x = year, y = .value),.width = c(.99, .95, .8, .5), color = "red") +
  geom_point(data = fluke_test %>% rename(lat = lat_round), aes(year, num_obs), size = 2,alpha = 0.5) + 
  facet_wrap(~lat, scales = "free_y") + 
  scale_fill_brewer()
```



```{r}
plot(model1_fit, pars = c("alpha","sigma_r"))
```
