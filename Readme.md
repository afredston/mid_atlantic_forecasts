### Guide to project code

This repository is organized as follows:

- `raw-data` contains any data that were not generated by us, in the form they were made available in (so not necessarily "raw", but not processed in this repository)
- `processed-data` contains data written out by code in this repository
- `functions` contains user-defined functions
- `src` contains source code for Stan models
- `results` contains results written out by the scripts 

Scripts are all in the main project folder. 

To run models for summer flounder, follow these steps:

1. Download the 2020 [OceanAdapt](oceanadapt.rutgers.edu) release from this stable DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.3885625](https://zenodo.org/record/3885625)
1. Run `import_summer_flounder.R` to pull in and filter these data
1. Run `get_summer_flounder_params.R` to mine parameters from summer flounder stock assessment tables 
1. Run `prep_summer_flounder.R` to reshape the data for the DRM
2. Explore `control_file.csv` and be sure you want to run the full factorial set of 64 models (if not, delete those rows)
